Installation
=================

GRASP
-------------------------------


To use GRASP, first make sure the following Matlab toolboxes are installed:

 - Parallel Computing Toolbox
 - Optimization Toolbox
 - Bioinformatics Toolbox

As well as `Gurobi <https://www.gurobi.com/>`_ for linear program solving. 
Even though Gurobi is a commercial solver it is possible to get a free academic license.

 
Then download GRASP from `here <https://github.com/biosustain/GRASP>`_, and you're ready to go.



Python visualization
-------------------------------

If you want to use the jupyter notebooks in the visualization folder to visualize the model's Gibbs energies vs. reaction fluxes and/or the results from Metabolic Control Analysis, you'll need the following python packages:

[TODO add requirements]

There is also a requirements.txt file in the visualization folder that you can use to install the above packages.
