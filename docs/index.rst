Welcome to GRASP's documentation!
=================================


GRASP is a framework used to build kinetic model ensembles based on a single data point, which is characterized by a flux distribution and Gibbs reaction energies.

The resulting model ensemble can then be simulated or subject to Metabolic Control Analysis.

What do you actually need to build the model?

 - fluxes for all reactions;
 - standard Gibbs energies for all reactions;
 - absolute metabolite concentrations;
 - if available, enzyme regulation information (enzyme inhibitors and activators);
 - if available, enzyme mechanism information.

 For more information on how the framework works, please see [TODO: refs to papers].
